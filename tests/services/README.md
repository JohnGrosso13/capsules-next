# Test Service Fixtures

This directory will host mock responses and service harnesses that Phase 6 QA relies on when scripting roster and ladder list recovery scenarios. Populate with JSON fixtures or helper scripts as needed when additional automation is added. For now it serves as the canonical location referenced by `docs/ladders-phase6-qa.md`.
